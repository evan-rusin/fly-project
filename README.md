## Build Instructions
### Application
For Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS users, run these commands:

1. First clone the project locally and then go into the directory


2. Setup our virtual environment

  **MacOS Environment:**

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv env
  ```

  **FreeBSD Environment:**

  ```bash
  virtualenv env
  ```


3. Activate virtual environment

  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```


4. **MacOS USERS ONLY:** If you are using *Postgres.app*, you’ll need to have *pg_config* setup in your *$PATH*. If you already have set this up, skip this step, else simply run this command in the console to set the path manually.


  ```bash
  export PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin:$PATH"
  ```


5. Now lets install the libraries this project depends on.

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```



### Database
We are almost done! Just follow these instructions and the database will be setup for the application to use. Load up your postgres and enter the console. Then to create our database, enter:

  **MacOS Environment:**

  ```sql
  create database fly_db;
  \c fly_db;
  CREATE USER django WITH PASSWORD NULL;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE fly_db to django;
  ALTER USER django CREATEDB;
  ```

  **FreeBSD Environment:**

  ```sql
  /usr/local/bin/dropdb fly_db;
  /usr/local/bin/createdb fly_db;
  /usr/local/bin/psql fly_db;
  CREATE USER freebsd WITH PASSWORD NULL;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE fly_db to freebsd;
  ALTER USER freebsd CREATEDB;
  ```



### Static Files Hosting
Files are stored on a remote server. The service we are using is [Amazon Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).



### Email
Emails are handled by communicating with a third-party API-based emailing service. The service we are using is [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com).



### Application + Database
Run the following command to create your custom settings instance. Note: Please write all your application passwords here as it won't be tracked on git.

  ```bash
  cd fly_project
  cp secret_settings_example.py secret_settings.py
  ```


Run the following commands to populate the database.

  ```bash
  cd ../
  python manage.py migrate
  python manage.py setup_fly
  ```

## Usage
To run the web-app, you’ll need to run the server instance and access the page from your browser.

Start up the web-server:

  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  python manage.py runserver
  ```


In your web-browser, load up the following url
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/
  ```

Congratulations, you are all setup to run the project! Have fun coding!
